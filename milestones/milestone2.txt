Milestone 2: Field Correlation Logic (View Quotation Edit Mode) - IN PROGRESS

Requirements:
- In View Quotation edit mode, the fields Quality, Flat or Raised, Direct or Reverse, and Thickness must have the same correlation logic as Create Quotation (HT).
- All relevant fields must be dropdowns (not plain text).
- Thickness validation: required only for Silicon+Raised, must be 0.1–1.5.
- UI feedback and Save button enable/disable must match Create Quotation (HT).
- Version number must be incremented and shown everywhere.
- Edit log must accurately record changes, distinguishing [USER] and [COMPUTER] changes.

Implementation Plan:
- Refactor View Quotation edit mode to use dropdowns for all relevant fields.
- Implement real-time field correlation logic (matching Create Quotation (HT)).
- Add validation for Thickness (only for Silicon+Raised, 0.1–1.5).
- Ensure Save button is only enabled when changes are valid and present.
- Update version numbers in all relevant files.
- Ensure edit log is accurate and persistent.

Status: IN PROGRESS
