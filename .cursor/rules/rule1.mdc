0. do not find short cut, when there is error, check the whole code thoroughly
and do not edit other not related code

1. Version Control Rules:
- When making a code change, increment version number (e.g., v1.1.8 → v1.1.9)
- Update ALL files that display the version number
- This ensures users always see the same version number regardless of how the page loads or which code path executes


2. Code Analysis Before Changes:
- Search ALL files for related code/functions first
- Check for multiple implementations of same function
- Identify ALL places where changes are needed
- Plan complete solution before making any changes

3. Making Changes:
- Fix root causes, not symptoms
- Update all related files in one go
- Clear any competing implementations first
- Test changes thoroughly before committing

4. User-AI Communication:
USER:
- Report all issues together, not one by one
- Specify: Issue, Files affected, Current behavior, Expected behavior

AI:
- Acknowledge all issues
- List all affected files
- Explain root cause
- Show complete solution
- Update all files at once

5. Best Practices:
✅ DO:
- Complete analysis first
- Update all related files together
- Clear understanding before changes
- Fix root causes immediately

❌ DON'T:
- Make partial fixes
- Update only some files
- Try quick fixes without understanding
- Ignore user's repeated feedback

6. Time-Saving Rules:
- When user reports same issue multiple times, stop and rethink approach
- Pay attention to established best practices
- Listen to user feedback more carefully
- Fix core issues immediately instead of incremental fixes
